            </div>
            <b><p>A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a binary data designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership.[1][2] Some crypto schemes use validators to maintain the cryptocurrency. In a proof-of-stake model, owners put up their tokens as collateral. In return, they get authority over the token in proportion to the amount they stake. Generally, these token stakers get additional ownership in the token over time via network fees, newly minted tokens or other such reward mechanisms.[3] Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority.</p></b>

            <b><p>In an ideal world, one of the cryptocurrencies would eventually take over as the most influential international currency. However, being not as controlled as some governments/regulators would like, it’s unlikely. SEC and other regulators are already making the distant future of crypto quite unclear. Nevertheless, there is no need to lose all optimism regarding its future. It’s a practically infant industry and with its lows, it’s had its impressive highs as well. More to come</p></b>

            </div><b>
            <p>Although Bitcoin was the first established cryptocurrency, there had been previous attempts at creating online currencies with ledgers secured by encryption. Two examples of these were B-Money and Bit Gold, which were formulated but never fully developed.

                2008 – The Mysterious Mr Nakamoto
                
                A paper called Bitcoin – A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System was posted to a mailing list discussion on cryptography. It was posted by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, whose real identity remains a mystery to this day.
                
                2009 – Bitcoin begins
                
                The Bitcoin software is made available to the public for the first time and mining – the process through which new Bitcoins are created and transactions are recorded and verified on the blockchain – begins.
                
                
                2010 – Bitcoin is valued for the first time
                
                As it had never been traded, only mined, it was impossible to assign a monetary value to the units of the emerging cryptocurrency. In 2010, someone decided to sell theirs for the first time – swapping 10,000 of them for two pizzas. If the buyer had hung onto those Bitcoins, at today’s prices they would be worth more than $100 million.
                
                2011 – Rival cryptocurrencies emerge
                
                As Bitcoin increases in popularity and the idea of decentralized and encrypted currencies catch on, the first alternative cryptocurrencies appear. These are sometimes known as altcoin and generally try to improve on the original Bitcoin design by offering greater speed, anonymity or some other advantage. Among the first to emerge were Namecoin and Litecoin. Currently there are over 1,000 cryptocurrencies in circulation with new ones frequently appearing.
